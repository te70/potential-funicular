# Backend development microservices
- I was able to build 4 microservices: Timestamp, Request header parser, URL shortner, Exercise and File metadata.
- Timestamp microservice: an api that returns a Unix timestamp after inputting a date
- Request header parser microservice: an api that returns ipaddress, language and software keys
- URL shorterner microservice: an api that does requests from mongo and returns a JSON response with the url and id
- Exercise microservice: an api that does requests from mongo to have usernames, exercises and logs
- File metadata microservice: an api that deals with file uploads used the multer package to handle uploads
- Used replit as the dev env
